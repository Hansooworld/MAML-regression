This repository is based on this paper :</br>
[Finn et al, "Model-agnostic meta-learning for fast adaptation of deep networks." [International conference on machine learning. PMLR, 2017.]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf)

You just need to run .ipynb file. </br>
For randomly sampled phase and amplitude, you will see that your model quickly adapts.
